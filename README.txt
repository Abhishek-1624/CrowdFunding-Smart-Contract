PROBLEM:-
Here we are trying to solve a real problem using smart contracts
In a general crowdfunding is used by people when they want to raise funds for a specific cause
But we have heard many people trying to manupilate others into getting funds
To solve this problem we are creating a smart contract

SOLUTION:-
Planning and Designing the smart contract

1.The Admin will start a campaign for CrowdFunding with specific monetary goal and deadline

2.Contributors will contribute to the project by sending ETH

3.The admin has to create a Spending Request to spend money for campaign

4.Once the spending request was created, The contributors can start voting for that specific Spending Request

5.If more than 50% of the total contributors voted for that request then the admin would have permission to 
  spend the amount specified in the spending request

6.THE POWER IS MOVED FROM THE ADMIN TO THE THOSE WHO DONATED THE MONEY 

7.The contributors can request a refund if the monetary goal was not reached within the deadline

Test the contract:-
To test the contract you can the above code on VS CODE OR the Remix IDE
